### ✨ What's New
- The `ls` command now shows Rewatching/Rereading Media along with Current Media. The Rewatching/Rereading media will be marked by **"(R)"** before the media title.
- You can now pass incremental or decremental progress to `update` command. For example,

  To increment progress of a media by 2,
  ```shell
  $ chibi update 8861 -p +2
  ```

  To decrement progress of a media by 5,
  ```shell
  $ chibi update 8861 -p -5
  ```
